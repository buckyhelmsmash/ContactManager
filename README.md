## Usage

To run the app on an Android emulator or device, use the following command:

```sh
npm run android
```

This command will start the development server and launch the app on the connected Android device.

## UI Libraries

The Contact Manager app utilizes the `@react-native-material/core` library for its UI components. This library provides a consistent and attractive design to enhance the user experience.

## State Management

State management in the Contact Manager app is implemented using **Redux** along with the **@reduxjs/toolkit** and **react-redux** packages. Redux enables centralized state management, making it easier to manage and share data across different components.

## Persistence

The app uses **redux-persist** in combination with **@react-native-async-storage/async-storage** to persist the Redux store data in the device's local storage. This ensures that user data and preferences are preserved even if the app is closed or restarted.
